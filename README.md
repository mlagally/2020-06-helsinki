Planned IRTF T2TRG/W3C WoT work meeting in Helsinki, 2020-06-08

In the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of new devices are being connected to the Internet.  At this scale, manual configuration is no longer affordable.  Devices need to make available self-descriptive information, and the systems using them need to discover and make use of this information, without the need for extensive human intervention.

A first set of standards for self-description and discovery has been completed by IETF and W3C.  How can these specifications best be used?  What are the gaps that still need to be addressed?  How can discovery be made secure and private, so that it doesn't disclose too much information and isn't susceptible to attacks?  How can the semantic information that guides discovery be structured in a way that maximizes interoperability, in particular where usage needs to cross different IoT ecosystems?  How can self-description and discovery be used to actually enhance security?

The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Thing to Thing Research group (T2TRG), and the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) Interest Group (IG) on the Web of Things (WoT) are meeting for a workshop on self-description and discovery on Monday, June 08, 2020, in Helsinki.  The date was chosen to coordinate with a number of other events, in particular the 20th International Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE 2020), also taking place in Helsinki on Tuesday, June 09, to Friday, June 12.

Participation in the workshop is open to IoT developers and researchers free of charge, but registration is required.  Logistical details are being collected at https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/F2F_meeting,_6-11_June_2020,_Helsinki
